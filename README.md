# BinarySpacePartitioning
Binary Space Partitioning or also known as BSP is a procedural generation method, where is a method for recursively subdividing a space into two convex sets by using 
hyperplanes as partitions. This method has been used in the game known as Doom.The corridors of the map use Bresenham's line algorithm.
Below are the pics of the evolution from the start to the final version of the map
